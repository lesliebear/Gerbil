 * The Grid class that holds the information about how the grid looks by using characters to represent

 * water can (the goal) is top right. 
 * 
 * Index of characters on grid:
 * k = Pumpkin, p for pear, a for apple, w for Wall, t for water container
 * 
 * Gerbil object already has it's own locations but if Gerbil does step
 * on a square with fruit, the character for the fruit will become upper 
 * case as to not lose data for the fruit's location
 * 
 * Note: In Java, for 2d Arrays (0,0) is in the top left of array.
